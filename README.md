# ts-starter

This is a simple starter for TS projects, it includes jest for testing and prettier(on commit via husky) to avoid long winded discussions about whether or not a newline should be added curly braces and the like.

## Prettier

Prettier recomends pinning an exact version in package.json you might want to do this after forking.
